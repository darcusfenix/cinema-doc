# Architecture of the microservices

This is the diagram that represents the architecture for the microservices that I designed.

I put three user stories.

1. As a user, I want to see all the movies in the gallery.

2. As a user, I want to see all the comments of a movie, so that I can know critiques of other users.

3. As a user, I want to add a comment to a movie, so that I can give my criticism to the people.
